for motor drivers PH/EN mode is used . phase pin controls direction and eneable pin duty cycle. 3 motor drivers control 3 motors speed and direction.
motor driver used was DRV8874. 



apb2 block is running at 160 mhz for motor drivers, apb1 is running at 3.2 mhz for esc and servo. this board allows us to control 3 brushed motors, one esc and one servo 
features usb connectivity and complete isolation of MCU from motor drivers. 

motors run on battery voltage about 15 volts(4s lipo), servo gets 5 volts from regulator. esc gets 18 volts from stepup driver, mcu gets 3.3 volts regulated from usb 5 v.


MCU configuration:
for motor controls we need 3 gpio and 3 pwm. for pwm timer 15 ch1 and ch2 , and timer 8 chanel 1 were used, all run at 160 mhz. 
for esc tim3 ch3 was used running at 3.2 mhz and for servo tim 3 ch2 was used. 

comunication is over usb and every time MCU gets 9 numbers separated by ';'. motor1speed(0;65000),motor2speed(0;65000),m3speed(0;65000),m1direction(0 or 1),m2direction(0 or 1),m3direction(0 or 1),servo(0-10000),esccpeed(0-10000),delimiter(99999)
